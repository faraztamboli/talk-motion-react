  aboutPageContent: (
    <p>
      TalkMotion began with a simple realization. When our founder and CEO, Faraz Tamboli, heard a story from his dad about a Deaf boy whose communication wasn’t understood in a hearing environment, it highlighted a familiar truth: the gap wasn’t in the boy—it was in the world around him. Moments like his reveal how easily two communities can drift into separate conversations when they don’t share a language. TalkMotion was created to help bridge that divide with respect for both worlds.
      <br />
      <br />
      TalkMotion is a cloud-based communication technology designed to support Deaf and aphonic people in navigating spaces—schools, workplaces, public environments—where their primary language may not be recognized. We believe communication is a human right, and everyone should be able to move through the world without barriers created by inaccessible systems.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our platform offers tools that make interactions smoother in both personal and professional settings. Whether you’re connecting with someone who doesn’t know sign language or want a clearer way to communicate in mixed-language spaces, TalkMotion helps extend your reach without compromising your identity, autonomy, or voice.

  TalkMotion was created to support communication in environments where sign language may not be widely understood. Deaf and aphonic people already communicate fluently in their own languages; barriers arise when systems and settings are not designed for them. Our technology helps bridge these gaps by offering real-time tools that facilitate communication across signing and non-signing communities.
