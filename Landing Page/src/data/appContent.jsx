      At TalkMotion, we believe that connecting to others is an inherent human
      need and that no one should be prevented from doing so because they
      can&apos;t speak.
      <br />
      <br />
      That&apos;s the problem we aim to solve. We&apos;ve developed an AI-based
      technology and tools that allow Deaf and Aphonic people to communicate
      with anyone, anywhere, with just the push of a button.
      <br />
      <br />
      We don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair for Deaf people to have to wait for
      someone else to make accommodations for them, or to have to give up their
      independence in order to get what they need. Instead, we believe that Deaf
      and Aphonic people should be able to take their communication wherever
      they go. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve created TalkMotion; we want you to be
      free to interact with everyone, everywhere.
      <br />
      <br />
      At TalkMotion, we are always working to improve the communication
      experience for our customers. If you have any questions or concerns about
      your product, please reach out to us. It is our mission to deliver the
      best communication experience possible, and our team is here to help with
      any issues you may be having.

  aboutPageContent: (
    <p>
      When our founder and CEO, Faraz Tamboli, heard about a story from his dad
      of a Deaf and aphonic child named Mona who was unable to communicate with
      him. Listening to how Mona was misunderstood, underestimated, and
      dismissed and how these gaps in communication created two different
      worlds, Faraz knew something needed to be done. And so TalkMotion was born
      to connect these two worlds!
      <br />
      <br />
      TalkMotion is a cloud-based communication technology that helps Deaf and
      aphonic people communicate easily with each other in school, at home, or
      in the workplace. We built this app because we believe that communication
      is a fundamental human need, and no one should have to feel restricted or
      excluded from being able to communicate freely.
      <br />
      <br />
      We provide an easy-to-use platform for Deaf and Aphonic people in both
      professional and personal environments by making it easy for them to
      connect with each other. Whether you&#39;re looking for friends who can
      sign or just want an easier way to talk at work, TalkMotion has got you
      covered!

      When we started TalkMotion, we were inspired by the fact that many Deaf
      and Aphonic people can communicate using sign language, but not everyone
      knows how to interpret sign language. We wanted to solve the problem of
      Deaf and Aphonic people being unable to communicate with the majority of
      the world—people who do not know sign language. That&apos;s why we created
      a product that can translate from sign language into speech in
      real-time—so anyone who uses TalkMotion can communicate with anyone else,
      regardless of whether or not they know sign language.
